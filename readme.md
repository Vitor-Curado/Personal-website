To be very honest, I don't know what I'm doing. Not with this website, not with my life. But as that saying goes, "you have to keep moving forward". 

For the podcasts, I want to have a tag holding every person in the given episode. Each person has a description, and podcast episodes can be filtered with guests. The episode itself has to have a description field, also a field with the duration in hours:minutes:seconds, date of publication. Of course, every episode has a title. Episodes can be bundled in playlists. I think that gets the job done quite well.

For foods, there's two parts, the food cards, and the dedicated link of each food. Some foods are specific to a given country (Medovik, vatapá, Worcestershire Puddings, French fries, Korean Fried Chicken), some foods are not necessarily attached to a given place so I find.
